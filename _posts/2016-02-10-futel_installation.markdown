I installed a [Futel](http://futel.net) phone in my front yard this past
weekend. I've been meaning to do it for some time now but finally got it
together.

I was originally planning to do a *free lending library* style enclosure and a
desk phone, but then Karl/Elijah hooked me up with this really nice courtesy
phone, so I went with that.

The phone enclosure is made of reclaimed wood from my fence, some yard refuse,
and a piece of free roofing I got from a bar. I built a small light out of
some spare LEDs I had and some frosted plastic that a friend left over at
my place. I think the enclosure has a somewhat outhouse or chicken-coop
look to it, which I'm pretty into.
