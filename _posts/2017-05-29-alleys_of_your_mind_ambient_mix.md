My friends Ian and Mikey run the [Alleys of your Mind radio show](http://www.freeformportland.org/show/alleys-of-your-mind/)
on [Freeform radio Portland](http://www.freeformportland.org/).
A while ago Ian asked me to make a mix for them to broadcast as I'm busy during
the time when I could do it live. I decided to make a mostly ambient mix as I
had been putting together some ambient tracks for a bit. Here it is, my mix
takes up about the first hour of the stream.
