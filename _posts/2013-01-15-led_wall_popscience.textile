Popular Science just published a brief blurb about our "LED wall":http://blog.x37v.info/2012/10/10/led-wall :
"Bright Ideas: DIY Stage Lights From The 1930s And Today":http://www.popsci.com/gadgets/article/2013-01/bright-ideas-portable-diy-performance-enhancement

They juxtaposed our project with a DIY Stage Lighting project they published a "design":http://books.google.com/books?id=yiUDAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA112#v=onepage&q&f=true for in 1937.
