Last year I joined the [Venerable Showers of Beauty](http://www.vsbgamelan.org/) (VSB) Javanese Gamelan. I have played with a few different groups now, but this is the first with regular gigs.

Next month we are part of an event where we will be playing a number of pieces by and inspired by Lou Harrison, a Portland born composer who used both western and non-western instruments in his compositions.

Here are some details of the event: [CeLOUbration: Concert Series Friday, June 16, 2017 - 7:30pm](https://www.pdx.edu/music/event/celoubration-concert-series?delta=0)

Anyways, before I joined they recorded a number of Lou Harrison pieces and they just released them!

I put together the [bandcamp posting](https://venerableshowersofbeauty.bandcamp.com/releases) for the release but otherwise I wasn't involved with this recording.

One of the group's members, [Brett Campbell](https://brettwriter.wordpress.com) co-wrote [a book about Lou Harrison](https://brettwriter.wordpress.com/2017/04/15/lou-harrison-american-musical-maverick-published-april-3-new-blog/) which is [now available](https://www.amazon.com/Lou-Harrison-American-Musical-Maverick/dp/0253026156/) as well.
